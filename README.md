# WebCrawler

The WebCrawler looks for a particulr search word at the URL given.
The crawler fetches the content of the html page and all the links found in it. If the word is found at the web page, the program returns that url otherwise it keeps looking in the links.
I have set the maximum number pf pages to look at as 10. That can be changed as per user requirement.
