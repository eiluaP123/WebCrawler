# WebCrawler

The WebCrawler looks for a particular search word at the URL given.
The crawler fetches the content of the html page and all the links found in it. If the word is found at the web page, the program returns that url otherwise it keeps looking in the links found at the web page.
I have set the maximum number of pages to look at as 10. That can be changed as per user requirement.
